## Copilot instructions — Better Template Extension

## 🚨 Critical Rules

1. **ask_user**: Always use the ask_user tool before completing any task to confirm with the user that the request was fulfilled correctly, or if you need an external validation by the user (ex.: a log entry).
2. Avoid using emojis
3. When you think "finalize the conversation", always ask the user if they need anything else through `ask_user` before ending the conversation.
